# S3

- Object storage, serverless, unlimited storage, pay-as-you-go
- Good to store static content (image, video files)
- Access objects by key, no indexing facility
- Not a filesystem, cannot be mounted natively on EC2


- Anti patterns:
  - Lots of small files
  - POSIX file system (use EFS instead), file locks
  - Search feature, queries, rapidly changing data
  - Website with dynamic content

# Storage Classes

- S3 standard
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- S3 Standard-IA
- S3 One Zone-IA
- S3 Glacier
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive


- You can transition objects between tiers (or delete) using S3 Lifecycle Policies
  

# Replication

- Cross Region Replication (CRR)
- Same Region Replication (SRR)
- Combine with Lifecycle Policies

- Helpful to reduce latency
- Helpful for disaster recovery
- Helpful for security

- S3 bucket versioning must be enabled

# S3 Events Notifications

- S3:ObjectCreated, S3:ObjectRemoved, S3:ObjectRestore, S3:Replication..
- Object name filtering possible (*.jpg)
- Use case: generate thumbnails of images uploaded to S3
- S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer
- If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent
- If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, you can enable versioning on your bucket

# Cloudwatch Events

- By default, CloudTrail records S3 bucket-level API calls
- CloudTrail logs for object-level Amazon S3 actions can be enabled
- This helps us generate events for object-level API (GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject, PutObjectAcl, etc..)

# Baseline Performance

- Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates, latency 100-200ms
- Your application can achieve at least 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix in a bucket.
- There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket
- Example (object path => prefix):
  - bucket/folder1/sub1/file => /folder1/sub1/
  - bucket/folder2/sub2/file => /folder2/sub2/

# Performance

- Multi-Part upload:
  - recommended for files > 100 MB, must use for files > 5GB
  - Can help parallelize uploads (speed up transfers)
- S3 Transfer Acceleration (upload only)
  - Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region
  - Compatible with multi-part upload

# Byte-Range Fetches

- Parallelize GETs by requesting specific byte ranges
- Better resilience in case of failures
- Can be used to speed up downloads
- Can be used to retrieve only partial data (for example the head of a file)

# S3 Select & Glacier Select

- Retrieve less data using SQL by performing server side filtering
- Can filter by rows & columns (simple SQL statements)
- Less network transfer, less CPU cost client-side
