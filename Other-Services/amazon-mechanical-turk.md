# Amazon Mechanical Turk

- Crowdsourcing marketplace to perform human tasks
- Distributed virtual workforce
- Integrates with SWF natively, does not integrate with Step Functions
  
Example:
- You have a list of 10,000 restaurant names in your area and you want to get the telephone number; opening hours, address etc
- Assume the restaurant name is not perfect, therefore Google API cannot help
- You distribute the task on Mechanical Turk and humans will fill your database
- Other use cases: image classification, data collection, business processing
